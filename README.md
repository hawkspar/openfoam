# About this case

This OpenFOAM case was developed by Quentin Chevalier (aka hawkspar) as part of his PhD from 2020 to 2023.

# Dependancies

This case is meant to be run in _OpenFOAM_. It is strongly recommanded to use the _docker_ image of this library using the tutorial https://www.cfdengine.com/blog/how-to-install-openfoam-anywhere-with-docker/

# Scripts

This case contains a number of useful scripts
- `Allclean` clears the case, including geometry
- `Generatemesh` transforms a `.msh` file into a suitable _OpenFOAM_ geometry. This involves a few shenanigans to convert patchs on boundaries into more useful objects
- `Computationrun` does the heavy lifting and decomposes, recomposes and prints
- `Hotstart` is a wrapper that removes `log.` files generated by previous `runApplication` and starts `Computationrun` again
- `Allrun` is a wrapper to run `Allclean`,  `Generatemesh` and `Computationrun`
- `Viscouscont` conveniently does the whole case from Re=1000 to Re=200000, and then loops so that swirl can be increased

# Hidden tricks

`0.orig/U` also contains several pieces of C code. This was the only way the author found to change boundary conditions during an _OpenFOAM_ computation. This approach has the major downfall that any change there means starting the entire computation from scratch, as boundary conditions are compiled in `gmshToFoam` or elsewhere early in the calculations
